# Resources and Logistics

## Online Coursepack

Online Coursepack @ [https://sde-coursepack.github.io/](http://sde-course.com/)

This will act as the textbook for this course. This is a free resource that is authored and maintained by Prof. McBurney. If you find typos/minor errors, you can submit fixes as pull-requests to https://github.com/sde-coursepack/sde-coursepack.github.io 

## Where do I go for resources/help?

* Announcements -> Canvas
* Slides -> Drive Folder
* In-class code -> Drive Folder
* Homework instructions -> Drive Folder
* Lecture recordings -> Canvas
* Quizzes -> Canvas
* Finding a team -> In-class or Piazza (using the LFG pinned post)
* Concept questions -> Piazza or Office hours
* Coding/debugging help -> Office hours **only**
* Regrades -> Gradescope **only**
* Personal issues -> Email your professor

## Canvas

Canvas has links to all other course material.

- Links to all other class resources
- Lecture recordings
- Quizzes 
- Exams
- Gradebook 

## Course Website

This is the website that you are currently on. The schedule and assignments information page will include links to 
the drive folder for Lecture Notes, Slides, Assignment Write-ups,
and Submission documents.

## Drive Folder

The student Drive Folder contains:
- Example Code
- Up-to-date Course Schedule
- Assignment Information
  - Directions
  - Submission Documents
  - Sample input files

Note that all content in the Drive Folder can be accessed via
the Schedule page on the Course Website. 

## Online Coursepack

Online Coursepack @ [https://sde-coursepack.github.io/](http://sde-course.com/)

There is no official textbook for the course that you need to purchase. Prof. Will McBurney
is writing an "online textbook" at the URL above, which at the start of the semester is about ~70% completed

If you would like to participate, you can clone the repository of the
online textbook and submit pull requests:

[Coursepack Github Repository](https://github.com/sde-coursepack/sde-coursepack.github.io)

All assistance will be credited. I am accepting pull requests for:
- Editing/typo/grammar fixes
- Interesting examples/tutorials
- Additional Source code examples 
- Anything you would like to add to help

All credit for contribution [will be included on this page](https://sde-coursepack.github.io/modules/about/about/)

Assigned Readings for each Lecture are listed and linked in the
lecture notes for that lecture on the Drive Folder. Readings are
strongly encouraged to be completed before class.

Content in the readings that are not covered directly in lecture
are considered "fair game" for exams.

## Gradescope

Every homework assignment will have a document to submit. You will not submit
any code on Gradescope (your code will be on Github). You will only
submit PDF documents.

Exams will be graded on Canvas.

All regrade requests are handled on Gradescope. Please be aware that
if a regrade request results in a grade change, it can take up to one
week for that change to be reflected on Canvas's Gradebook, as syncing
the Gradebook to Gradescope is a very time-consuming process, and we will
likely only do it once at the *end* of the regrade request period.


## Piazza

Piazza @ (access through Canvas)

We will be using Piazza for the following:

* Looking for teammates
* Long-form questions about the class, code, or project (please post all code privately!)
* Private messages for faculty or the entire staff
* A searchable repository of common questions in the course about the project, assignments, etc.

We will not be using Piazza for:

* Any code debugging for *any* reason. All questions for help with your specific code must be in office hours only.
* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then professor office hours only if not resolved)

## Email

We will be using email for the following:

* Personal issues that can and should only be handled by a professor

Your Email subject line should start with "[SDE]" OR "[CS 3140]"

We will not be using email for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope)
* Debugging/Coding help (use Office Hours)
* Installation Help (use Piazza or Office Hours)
* Homework Questions (use Piazza)

_PLEASE_ be patient with us in responding. 

Emails will generally be responded to within the next two *business* days
(not including weekends or holidays). If you do not hear back within three
*business* days, please email us again. It's possible your first email was
missed, we forgot to hit *send*, etc. We are human, we will make mistakes
in a class this large.


# Assessment and Grading

| Grade | Minimum Percentage |
|-------|--------------------|
| A     | 93.0%              |
| A-    | 90.0%              |
| B+    | 87.0%              |
| B     | 83.0%              |
| B-    | 80.0%              |
| C+    | 77.7%              |
| C     | 73.0%              |
| C-    | 70.0%              |
| D+    | 67.0%              |
| D     | 63.0%              |
| D-    | 60.0%              |
| F     | 0.0%               |


_There is **no** grading rounding_.


Grading in this class will be based one:
* Homework Assignments (4) - 70%  
	* 15% each for Homework 1 through 3
	* 25% for Homework 4
* Quizzes (10) - 10%
	* Must pass at least 8 quizzes for full credit
* Mastery-based Assessments (4) - 20% (5% each) in lieu of exams
* Optional final exam (retake up to 3 mastery-based assessments)

There might be some extra credit opportunities.

## Homework Assignments

There will be 4 homework assignments. These assignments will be mostly Java programming
assignments. Each assignment is independent and doesn't require using any code you wrote
from previous assignments. That said, homework assignments may reference previous assignments.

Assignment purpose:
* HW1 - Thinking about design and responding to change
* HW2 - Testing and clean code 
* HW3 - Refactoring and Java Streams
* HW4 - Final project with Java GUI

You will be given starter code to work with. This starter code will be automatically added to your teams GitHub Repository when you begin the assignment.

**All assignments are intended to take several days to complete**. Starting on an assignment late
will not earn any leniency in deadlines, grading, etc. Office Hours will become busier closer
to deadlines, so students should start early.

### Assignment Teams

All assignments except HW2 are designed to be done collaboratively. Assignments have a cap of 3 people.
Rules on assignment teams:

1. You can only work with a specific person up to **3 assignments**. You may not work with someone on 4 or more assignments.
2. All team members must join that team's Github repository. All assignment work is committed, shared, and submitted via Github.
3. Everyone on a given team gets the same grade for their assignment. (See Team concerns below)
4. Once you have added someone to your team, you cannot remove them **for any reason** for that assignment. 
5. If someone on your team hasn't contributed, you are encouraged to let the professor know, as well as not work with that person in the future.
6. You are welcome to work alone or with a smaller group than suggested. However, the assignment requirements will be the same, regardless of group size. Individual programmers will be held to the same expectations as groups.
7. The instruction staff will not put you on a team, nor will they find a team for you. You are responsible for forming your own teams.


#### Team Concerns

**All team members are expected to contribute working code to every assignment!** If you do not show any meaningful source code commits on GitHub, you may receive the following penalties at the discretion of the professor:

* Zero on the homework assignment (regardless the score of your teammates)
* You may be required to complete up to all remaining assignments **individually**, meaning you will not be allowed to form a group.
* In severe cases, you may receive an additional professionalism penalty in the course.

The goal of this class is to leave this class with the programming skills and tools under your belt to succeed in project work. If you do not contribute work

### Advice on Homework

1. It's better to have working code that implements some features than to have non-working code that attempts to implement all features
2. Submissions that cannot be compiled or executed without crashing **will not receive partial credit**
3. Start early - in the worst case you'll finish early and have more free time.
4. Break the assignment into several individual features. 
   1. Have different people implement each those features in separate classes/files.
   2. Do not have one giant main-class or main-method 
      1. This isn't sustainable for collaborative work
      2. This makes it nearly impossible to test your code effectively
5. Expect to spend at least half of your time testing and debugging
   1. You will whether you plan to or not
6. Commit early and often
   1. Think of committing like "saving" a file. 
   2. You should commit after each "unit of work" (wrote a function, wrote a test, fixed a bug)
   3. You shouldn't need to push after every commit. Push when you've completed a feature!
7. Always work in a branch, not in main.
   1. When you want to add your code to main, merge your branch to main.
8. Never push code directly to main. 
9. When fixing a bug, write a test *first*
   1. The test should fail
   2. The bug is fixed when the test passes
10. Never push code you haven't tested/run
    1. Especially right before the deadline!
    2. This has caused many teams to lose substantial points!

### Late Policy
 
Most assignments may be submitted up to one week late at a penalty of 5% per 24-hour period. 
(note that this penalty is subtractive, meaning if you score 85%, but it is one day late, 
you will get 80%). All members of an assignment team will get the same late penalty, regardless of contribution (as all members of an assignment team get the same grade on the assignment). 

**After 7 days, submissions will no longer be accepted.**

Homework 4 will have a separate late policy - no late submissions for any reason. 
   1. This is in order to ensure:
      1. TAs have time to grade the final assignment
      2. Students have time to study for the final exam
   2. In order to ensure students have time to study for final exams

We will only ever grade your most recent submission (all submissions on Gradescope will include the hash of your commit at the time you submit). We will not grade multiple submissions and give
you the best score.

Generally, no extension requests will be granted on homework assignments. This is because each assignment is 
laddered with specific course content. Additionally, new assignments are released when 
the previous assignment is due, and so you should switch to focus on the new assignment.

If there is a serious issue that requires a prolonged absence, you should contact your professor. 
However, because all assignments are team-oriented, and work can be shared remotely over Git, 
extensions are unlikely to be granted for illness.


### Homework collaboration policy

**You should *at no point* see any submitted work (code, question answers, etc.)
from any other team *for any reason whatsoever*.** This simple rule is the basis of our 
collaboration policy. In this course, you are encouraged to work with 1-2 other people on 
homework assignments. Obviously, you will be sharing code with your teammates 
over Git. *However, you should **at no point share any of your direct work** with anyone
on any other team **for any reason.*** You may not share or publicly post **any homework, quiz, or exam content** in this course.

Only the following people may look at your homework code for any reason:
1. The professors  
2. The TAs  
3. Your team members  

Be aware: this means you **may not publicly post or share any software generated in this class**, including as part of a portfolio, without explicit permission from your professor. Such permission will usually only be given on the final assignment of the semester.

In the case where code is found to have been shared between teams, all teams involved will
be treated as having violated the academic integrity policy. People who shared their code
will receive the same penalty as people who received the code.

Acceptable collaboration between teams is allowed. However, as a general rule, all collaboration should be "pencils down". That is, if 
you are being so specific in your discussion that you feel you need to write something down, you are probably being too specific. You can,
however, discuss any of the following:
* General algorithms/data structures to use for some part of the function   
* Design strategies for the assignment  
* External libraries you found helpful.  

All submissions in this course will be checked using cheat detection software. If it is found
that you shared code, **intentionally or unintentionally** with any member of another team.

Ignorance of these rules will not be accepted as a defense for violating them.

### Homework external resources policy

**You are allowed and encouraged to use external resources** like StackOverflow, 
Geeksforgeeks, etc. for looking up help with **individual parts** 
of your assignments (such as how to read a JSON file in Java, etc.). Professional
programmers look up syntax, library and class usage examples, etc. all the time.

However, **you may not copy large portions of external source code** from online. 
If you find you are copying more than 8 lines or so, you should stop. Copying code from any external source for significant portions of the assignment is considered academic dishonesty, and will be treated as such.

**All external references must be cited in your code comments!** (See How to Cite Code)

#### AI Assistance rules

Use of AI Assistants, like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc., is allowed **only in limited circumstances**. The rules are the same as StackOverflow - you may copy small snippets of code (typically small functions, etc.). You may not copy an entire class from an AI tool, and you should never copy more than 6 or so lines of code at a time. Copying code from any external source for significant portions of the assignment is considered academic dishonesty, and will be treated as such.

**All AI tool use must be cited in your code comments!!!** (See below)


#### How to Cite Code

Use the following format as an example citing code you use. You may not have all of these fields available, but this should give you a good idea of things to look for.  Order by title of the software package.  Use the appropriate commenting format for the programming language of your source code.  

Below is a general example of a citation format. This should appear **above** any code derived from an external source.

```
//  URL: <where it's located>
//  Description: <what you used, be very specific with line numbers>
```

If you get help from a TA or professor, you must also cite
that in your code.

```
//  Person: Name of TA or professor - you must include a name. "A TA" is not acceptable.
//  Description: <what you got help with, be very specific with line numbers>
```

If using an AI assistant, you must cite as follows:

```
//  AI Agent: (ChatGPT, Copilot, whatever)
//  Prompt: The *exact* prompt you used.
```

**Forgetting to cite your code with your sources** is not a defense against an academic
integrity violation, and will not be accepted as such. Ignorance of the rules
will not be accepted as a defense for violating them.

### Homework academic honesty violations

If it is found your submission violates our policies outline above, you will receive the following penalties depending on severity at the discretion of the professor:

* 0 on the entire assignment (not just the portion that violated our policies)
* Final Grade deduction in the course of one full letter grade (after applying a zero) of at least 10%
* F in the course
* Referral to Student Honor

In general, a second offense will *always* result in an F in the course and a referral to Honor, regardless of severity. If any member of your group violates our academic honesty policies, the entire group will be considered to have violated the policy. Generally, all members of the group could face the same penalties.

## Quizzes

There will be occasional quizzes in the class which are meant to ensure basic understanding of the course lecture material.
Quizzes will be posted on Canvas and are multiple choice. 

**Quizzes can be taken up to 5 times** to achieve the target score. You will be able to see your total quiz score after submitting. However, you won't see specifically what you got right/wrong, or the correct answer until after the quiz closes.

Your lowest two quizzes will be dropped.

Quizzes are **individual assignments**. Collaboration/working together (even with assignment team members for homeworks) is strictly prohibited.
If collaboration is discovered, it will result in all parties involved receiving a zero on their entire quiz grade for the course.

## Exams

### Mastery-based Exams

There will be four mastery-based exams during the course, each worth 5% of the course grade.

If you are absent for a mastery-based exam, you will have an opportunity to retake it at the end of the semester.

### Final Exam

In lieu of a final, you can re-take up to three (3) mastery-based exams and receive an updated grade. Retakes can only help your grade.

UVA has strict final exam policies. As such, we cannot grant make-ups or alternative exam time.  

### Exam Rules

Exams are **in-person**, closed note, closed book. Format will be on Canvas, though instructors may opt to change the exam for everyone to paper and pencil. Those with extended time or other accommodations should schedule proctored exams during the first two weeks of the class.  All exams must be in a proctored setting. Because of the electronic format, screen capture or recording of any part of an exam is expressly forbidden. A student recording exam questions will receive a failing grade for the course and may be referred to Honor. 


## Regrade Requests

Regrade Requests can be submitted on Gradescope within one week of an assignment's scores
being posted. Regrade requests cannot be accepted for any reason after the regrade request
deadline.

Regrade requests are for when **the existing rubric was applied incorrectly**. The following
will be considered frivolous regrade requests and will be rejected without further consideration:
* Arguing that the rubric should be changed
* Arguing the existing rubric took too many points away for a particular error
* Arguing for partial credit when your submitted code does not compile or run without crashing
* Asking for additional points to reach a grade threshold

Repeated frivolous regrade request will result in:
* All future regrade requests being declined without examination
* A professionalism deduction to your final grade

Regrade requests can result in your **entire assignment** being regraded. If,
for example, during a regrade request, you find you should have received a deduction
and you mistakenly did not, a regrade request could result in you losing points. 

Regrade requests should be written **professionally and respectfully**. Understand that
with a class of several hundred students, there *will* be grading errors. None of the
course staff are trying to make errors, however they will happen. Regrade requests should
explain how you feel the existing rubric was applied wrong in a calm and respectful tone.
Insults, profanity, and unprofessional language will result in a professionalism deduction
to your final course grade, and your regrade request being declined.

# Class Management

## Attendance

* In person attendance at lecture section is required; however, attendance will not be taken.

* In person attendance is required for exams 

* Students are encouraged to attend their registered lecture section; however, you may attend the other section's lecture occasionally as needed. Exams must be taken during the registered section. (Students will not have access to the exam outside of their section.)

## Lecture Recordings

* Live Lectures will **not** be recorded. Recordings are not an alternative to attending class, and this class is not meant to be taken remotely.
* Supplementary course content may be recorded as short videos and made available through Panopto in Canvas.

## This Syllabus

This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted 
through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be 
changed at any time. Significant changes will be announced. It is up to the student to monitor 
this page and their announcements for any changes. 
The final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

## Professionalism

In this course, there will be a focus on working well together and learning about the development process. A large portion of that process involves interpersonal skills and conflict management. Students and staff are all expected to treat each other with respect.  This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

* Misuse of class platforms (Piazza, Github, etc.)
* Disrespectful language or actions to course staff or other students
* Disrupting lecture or office hours with another student
* Unprofessionally written work. All written answers should be in complete sentences and written for a professional college setting.
* Not participating in work with your partners (such as no commits, missing scheduled meetings, etc.)
* Unauthorized collaborating with other teams

Students can and will be penalized for unprofessional behavior with deductions to their final grade. The deductions can be up to and including 100% in the class.

## Academic Integrity
{: .no_toc }
_Summary_:

* Know the honor code
* Work with your team, but not any other team
* Using code from other students (from any semester) is an honor violation
* Using publicly-available example code and libraries is fine, but you must cite your resources
* Posting any of yours or a classmate's work from homework, quizzes, or exams publicly anywhere on the internet is an honor violation
  * This includes your public Github Profile, Chegg, StackOverflow, CourseHero, etc. - This is strictly prohibited!
* More information on what is allowed will be included with each assignment if necessary
* It never hurts to ask the staff what is allowed or not allowed!

The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community 
of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle 
that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. 
We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that 
has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor w
ill benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering 
School and in the future. 

Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the 
section on academic fraud [http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud](http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud). 
Assessments will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be 
considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! 
Unless otherwise noted, all assessments will be considered pledged that you have 
neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not 
allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who 
has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student 
or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, 
receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files 
that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for 
those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations 
occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such 
infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is 
appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to 
work with partners on remaining homeworks. 

For CS3140, using code developed by previous students in the course or code written 
for your use by someone outside the course is not allowed and will likely be an 
honor violation. This does not apply to the use of publicly available frameworks 
and libraries, unless indicated in the assessment instructions.

In general, we expect that you will be using code, examples, and ideas from many 
websites and resources for your homeworks.  This is allowed within reason.  
Wholesale copying of an entire project or any major feature from any source 
(the web, another student, etc.) is definitely not allowed.  Using code snippets 
that you find to round out a feature is allowed **with citation**. 
If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, ask first!

In ALL cases, you need to cite all sources within the code where the code or 
algorithm was used  Failure to properly attribute your sources will result in 
a deductions up to 100% on assignments, and be considered an academic integrity
violation in the worst case.

## Miscellaneous Policies

### Inclement Weather Policy

If there is the possibility of inclement weather that could affect class, it is your responsibility to stay informed.  Information about how to sign up for email and/or text alerts from UVA Emergency Management, along with the current University status, can be found at [https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/](https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/).

### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, 
materials, or requirements of this course, please make an appointment to with your instructor outside of class so we can explore 
potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a 
range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC 
advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her 
at [cmacmasters@virginia.edu](mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment. For general questions please 
visit the SDAC website: [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu).

If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send your instructor your accommodation letter 
as soon as possible. We happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. 
For quizzes, we cannot grant extensions, as the quiz solutions are released at the due time.  For team homework assignments, 
we cannot grant significant accommodations to deadlines for an entire team due to accommodations of individuals on the team. 
However, we can discuss with you the best way to integrate with your team with your accommodations 
in consideration. Please make an appointment with your instructor outside of office hours to have this discussion.

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.), please contact the instructor as soon as you know these may affect you in class.

### Religious Accommodations

It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to their instructor by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200.

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework - including homework assignments - missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Support for Career Development
{: .no_toc }
Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. We wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify your instructor by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.

### Student Support Team
{: .no_toc }
You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help!

__NOTE:__ These resources are available for BACS majors as well!  You are still a part of our department!

### Community and Identity
{: .no_toc }
The [Center for Diversity in Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/diversity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering) (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world.  The CDE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.


## Statement on Violence
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:
 
1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated. 
2. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
 
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - [www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence). 
 
As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being 
and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, 
I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy 
and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. 
The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the 
resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented 
to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the 
safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, 
there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See [http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf)). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to 
remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.

As your professors and as people, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As faculty members, we are a responsible employee, which means that we are required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to us to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.
